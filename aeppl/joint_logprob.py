    r"""Create a map between random variables and the associated conditional log-densities.

    Consider the following Aesara model:

    .. code-block:: python

        import aesara.tensor as at

        srng = at.random.RandomStream(0)
        sigma2_rv = srng.invgamma(0.5, 0.5)
        Y_rv = srng.normal(0, at.sqrt(sigma2_rv))

    Which represents the following mathematical model:

    .. math::

        \sigma^2 \sim& \operatorname{InvGamma}(0.5, 0.5) \\
        Y \sim& \operatorname{N}\left(0, \sigma^2\right)


    We can generate the graph that computes the conditional log-density associated
    with each random variable with:

    .. code-block:: python

        import aeppl

        logprobs, (sigma2_vv, Y_vv) = aeppl.conditional_logprob(sigma2_rv, Y_rv)

    The list of random variables passed to `conditional_logprob` implicitly
    defines a joint density that factorized according to the graphical model
    represented by the Aesara model. Here, ``logprobs[sigma2_rv]`` corresponds
    to the conditional log-density :math:`\operatorname{P}\left(sigma^2=s \mid Y\right)` and
    ``logprobs[Y_rv]`` to :math:`\operatorname{P}\left(Y=y \mid \sigma^2\right)`.

    To build the log-density graphs, `conditional_logprob` must generate the
    value variable associated with each random variable. They are returned along
    with the graph in the same order as the random variables were passed to
    `conditional_logprob`. Here, the value variables ``sigma2_vv`` and ``Y_vv``
    correspond to :math:`s` and :math:`y` in the previous expressions
    respectively.

    It is also possible to call `conditional_logprob` omitting some of the
    random variables in the graph:

    .. code-block:: python

        logprobs, (Y_vv,) = aeppl.conditional_logprob(Y_rv)

    In this case, ``logprobs[Y_rv]`` corresponds to the conditional log-density
    :math:`\operatorname{P}\left(Y=y \mid \sigma^2\right)` where
    :math:`\sigma^2` is a stochastic variable.

    Another important case is when one the variables is already realized. For
    instance, if `Y_rv` is observed we can include its realized value directly
    in the log-density graphs:

    .. code-block:: python

        y_obs = Y_rv.copy()
        logprobs, (sigma2_vv,) = aeppl.conditional_logprob(sigma2_rv, realized={Y_rv: y_obs})

    In this case, `conditional_logprob` uses the value variable passed in the
    conditional log-density graphs it produces.

    Parameters
    ==========
    random_variables
        A ``list`` of  random variables for which we need to return a
        conditional log-probability graph.
    realized
        A ``dict`` that maps realized random variables to their realized
        values. These values used in the generated conditional
        log-density graphs.
    warn_missing_rvs
        When ``True``, issue a warning when a `RandomVariable` is found in
        the graph and doesn't have a corresponding value variable specified in
        `rv_values`.
    ir_rewriter
        Rewriter that produces the intermediate representation of Measurable Variables.
    extra_rewrites
        Extra rewrites to be applied (e.g. reparameterizations, transforms,
        etc.)

    Returns
    =======
    conditional_logprobs
        A ``dict`` that maps each random variable to the graph that computes their
        conditional log-density implicitly defined by the random variables passed
        as arguments. ``None`` if a log-density cannot be computed.
    value_variables
        A ``list`` of the created valued variables in the same order as the
        order in which their corresponding random variables were passed as
        arguments. Empty if ``random_variables`` is empty.

    r"""Build the graph of the joint log-density of an Aesara graph.

    Consider the following Aesara model:

    .. code-block:: python

        import aesara.tensor as at

        srng = at.random.RandomStream(0)
        sigma2_rv = srng.invgamma(0.5, 0.5)
        Y_rv = srng.normal(0, at.sqrt(sigma2_rv))

    Which represents the following mathematical model:

        \sigma^2 \sim& \operatorname{InvGamma}(0.5, 0.5) \\
        Y \sim& \operatorname{N}\left(0, \sigma^2\right)

    We can generate the graph that computes the joint log-density associated
    with this model:

    .. code-block:: python

        import aeppl

        logprob, (sigma2_vv, Y_vv) = aeppl.joint_logprob(sigma2_rv, Y_rv)

    To build the joint log-density graph, `joint_logprob` must generate the
    value variable associated with each random variable. They are returned along
    with the graph in the same order as the random variables were passed to
    `joint_logprob`. Here, the value variables ``sigma2_vv`` and ``Y_vv``
    correspond to the values :math:`s` and :math:`y` taken by :math:`\sigma^2`
    and :math:`Y`, respectively.

    It is also possible to call `joint_logprob` omitting some of the random
    variables in the graph:

    .. code-block:: python

        logprob, (Y_vv,) = aeppl.joint_logprob(Y_rv)

    In this case, ``logprob`` corresponds to the joint log-density
    :math:`\operatorname{P}\left(Y, \sigma^2\right)` where :math:`\sigma^2` is
    a stochastic variable.

    Another important case is when one of the variables is already realized. For
    instance, if `Y_rv` is observed we can include its realized value directly
    in the log-density graphs:

    .. code-block:: python

        y_obs = Y_rv.copy()
        logprob, (sigma2_vv,) = aeppl.joint_logprob(sigma2_rv, realized={Y_rv: y_obs})

    In this case, `joint_logprob` uses the value ``y_obs`` mapped to ``Y_rv`` in the
    conditional log-density graphs it produces, so that ``logprob`` corresponds
    to the density :math:`\operatorname{P}\left(\sigma^2 \mid Y=y\right)` when
    :math:`y` and :math:`Y` correspond to ``y_obs`` and ``Y_rv``, respectively.
